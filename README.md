# ImgProcessor
Purpose: This project provides a suite of tools for advanced image processing and efficient management of image datasets. It's designed for applications in machine learning and computer vision, where preprocessing, augmentation, and organization of image data are critical.

#Grayscale.py: 
Contains a function to_grayscale for converting color images to grayscale. This function performs an accurate color conversion, considering gamma correction and color weighting, which is crucial for tasks where color information is secondary.
Also includes functions prepare_image and pixelate for applying a pixelation effect to images. This can be useful for creating data augmentation effects or for privacy purposes by obscuring parts of an image.


#SimpleImageDataset:
A subclass of PyTorch's Dataset for straightforward loading of images from a specified directory. It facilitates the easy retrieval of images for machine learning models.

#AugmentedImageDataset: 
Extends the functionality of SimpleImageDataset by applying transformations to each image in the dataset. This class is instrumental in performing on-the-fly data augmentation, which is a key technique in enhancing the diversity and size of training datasets in machine learning.

#Image Loading and Augmentation:

#The project includes a utility function load_and_transform_image for loading and optionally transforming images using PIL and torchvision transforms.
#It demonstrates the application of typical image transformations such as resizing, flipping, and color adjustments, critical for preprocessing steps in computer vision tasks.
